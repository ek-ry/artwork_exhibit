                    One of the best lines that Gojo Satoru has ever said in Jujutsu Kaisen. Gojo Satoru is
                    a teacher at Jujutsu Kaisen High and a special Jujutsu Sorcerer. Gojo wears a black blindfold to cover his eyes because using 
                    his eyes too much would tire himn out quickly. His jujutsu is called Six Eyes, which has been passed down from his family
